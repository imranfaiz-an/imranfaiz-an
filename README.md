My name is Faizan and I am a graduate student at the University of Chicago, enrolled in the [Master's in Computational Analysis and Public Policy Program (CAPP)](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) and will graduate in the Summer of 2027. Before joining the CAPP program at UChicago I worked as a Research Assistant at [the Center for Economic Research in Pakistan](https://www.cerp.org.pk/) and [Mahbub ul Haq Research Centre at LUMS](https://mhrc.lums.edu.pk/) my research work there focused on the political economy of institutions in the context of the Global South and how economic, social and political institutions impact development. At UChicago through my coursework in Computer Science I am learning how technical tools can be employed to understand and explore complex societal issues and I am also working as a part time RA at the [Social Sciences Division](https://socialsciences.uchicago.edu/), where I am evaluating how economic elites use electoral signals to offshore their wealth when a leader with left leaning tax agenda is elected to office.

Please feel free to explore the projects I am currently working on or have worked on in the past, including selected coursework, to get a better sense of my skills and experience:

- [MSCAPP Coursework](https://github.com/imranfaiz-an/capp_coursework):  A summary of selected coursework in computer science completed at the University of Chicago as part of the CAPP program.

- [George Washington Carver Centre for the Advancement of Science and Education - Mapping Stem Educational Disparities](https://github.com/imranfaiz-an/gw_carver): A project I worked on over two days during 2025 Scopeathon that hosted 9 organizations from the South Side of Chicago. Our team of 3 worked with GWC Visualizing the disparities in stem educational outcomes and facilities in the South side of Chicago. Merging various datasets to perform a zip code level analysis.

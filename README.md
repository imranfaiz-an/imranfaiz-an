My name is Muhammad Faizan Imran and I am a graduate student at the University of Chicago. I am enrolled in the [Master's in Computational Analysis and Public Policy Program](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) and I will graduate in Summer 2027. Before joining the MSCAPP program at UChicago I worked as a Research Assistant at [the Center for Economic Research in Pakistan](https://www.cerp.org.pk/) and [Mahbub ul Haq Research Centre at LUMS](https://mhrc.lums.edu.pk/) my research focus has been the political economy of institutions in the context of the Global South and how economic, social and political institutions impact development. At UChicago I am continuing my work as an RA at the [Social Sciences Division](https://socialsciences.uchicago.edu/) and I am evaluating the offshore financing by the elite based on signal related to local reforms that would have an impact on their wealth.

Please feel free to explore the projects I am currently working or have worked on the past including some coursework to get a better sense of my skills and experience:

Merging various datasets to perform a zip code level analysis.

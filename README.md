My name is Muhammad Faizan Imran and I am a graduate student at the University of Chicago. I am enrolled in the [Master's in Computational Analysis and Public Policy Program (CAPP)](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) and will graduate in the Summer of 2027. Before joining the CAPP program at UChicago I worked as a Research Assistant at [the Center for Economic Research in Pakistan](https://www.cerp.org.pk/) and [Mahbub ul Haq Research Centre at LUMS](https://mhrc.lums.edu.pk/) my research focus has been the political economy of institutions in the context of the Global South and how economic, social and political institutions impact development. At UChicago I am continuing my work as an RA at the [Social Sciences Division](https://socialsciences.uchicago.edu/), where I am evaluating offshore financing by elites in response to signals related to local reforms that may affect their wealth.
